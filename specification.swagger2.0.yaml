  title: Servicemap API
  description: |-
      The Servicemap API provides categorized data on services, both public and private, and service locations within a city or metropolitan area.

      The API provides data in the JSON format, in a RESTful fashion.

      The two most important resources provided by the API are

      1. **units**, concrete physical locations which provide services to citizens, and
      2. **services**, which are the categories of services that can be provided by units.

      There are several more supporting resources linked to units in one way or another, and they are all specified in this documentation.

      Several fields are multilingual. These are implemented as objects with each language variant as property.

          service_reference:
            type: string
            description: |
              An expression of set theory or propositional calculus which describes the conditions a unit\'s services must satisfy in order for this service node to apply to the unit. Thus, the set of services of a unit is always the primary data and the service nodes are derived from that set.
              In the expression,
              - numbers are service ids,
              - the * token is the AND operator or a set theoretical intersection, and
              - the + token is the OR operator or a set theoretical union, and
              - the AND operator has a higher precedence than the OR operator.

              The expression is interpreted as follows. Iff the set of services of unit U satisfies the service_reference expression of a service node N, then the unit has the service node N in its service_node field. Also, filtering all units by the service node N will return the unit U as part of the result set.
              For example, if the service node 1 has the value "1\*2+3\*4" as the service_reference, and unit 1 provides the services 2, 3, and 4, then the unit has the service node 1 in its service_node field, because the unit provides the services (1 AND 2) OR (3 AND 4), because the unit provides the services (3 AND 4), because the unit has both services 3 and 4 associated with it.

      rules:
        type: object
        description: |
          An object consisting of boolean expressions that are used to calculate whether a given unit satisfies the accessibility requirements of a given user. The same set of rules are used for any unit: a unit\'s accessibility properties are used as values when evaluating the rules for the given unit.

          The **top level keys** of the object encode users\' accessibility profiles, which consist of a number and a letter. The numbers represent

          1. A wheelchair user
          2. Someone with reduced mobility
          3. A rollator user
          4. Someone pushing a stroller
          5. Someone who is visually impaired
          6. Someone who is using a hearing aid

          The letters represent the person\'s mode of transportation

          A. Without a vehicle or using public transportation
          B. With their own car
          C. With a car and a separate driver

          The values of the object form a boolean expression tree, which is evaluated using the accessibility properties data of a unit. Whenever a primitive boolean expression or a compound one with a non-null **msg** field is evaluated as **true**, we have found a shortcoming or problem for this user when accessing this unit. The corresponding message from the **messages** array (see below) must be displayed to the user. A primitive exporession is evaluated by comparing the relevant accessibility property value using the operator to the value given in the expression. Usually this is an equality comparison between the first operand (a unit accessibility property identifier, and a second one (a possible value for the property)).
